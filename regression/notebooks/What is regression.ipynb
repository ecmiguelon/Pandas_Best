                "**Logistic regression** is used to predict **categories** such as yes/no or accepted/rejected. A loan being denied is a yes/no, so the Reveal story above uses logistic regression. Logistic regression is also very common when looking at bias or discrimination.\n",

                "\n",
                "We can also recognize regression from the phrases \"all other factors being equal\" or \"controlling for differences in.\" Notice how in the Reveal example above the African American/Latino population matters \"even after accounting for income and other factors.\"\n",

In the Associated Press piece, they show the relationship between unemployment and life expectancy.\n",
                "* **Finding unexpected outliers:** In [this piece](http://clipfile.org/?p=754) from the Dallas Morning News, they used regression analysis to predict a school's 4th grade standardized test scores based on their 3rd grade scores. Schools that did much much much better than expected were suspected of cheating.\n",

For example, we might have forgotten some useful variable, or maybe a few variables are fighting with each other and ruining our results (which sounds more fun than \"multicollinearity\").\n",

There are two kinds of regression, **linear regression** which is used to predict numbers, and **logistic regression** which is used to predict categories (typically yes/no answers).\n",
