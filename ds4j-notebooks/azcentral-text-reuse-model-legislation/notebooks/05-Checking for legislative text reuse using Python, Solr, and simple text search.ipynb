Private Right of Action.\\n\\n(a)\u00a0 A person who reasonably relies upon an act or practice declared unlawful by [SECTION] in entering into a transaction and thereby suffers an ascertainable loss of money or property may bring an action under this Act to enjoin further violations, or to recover as damages the out-of-pocket loss the person sustained as a result of such act or practice, or both.\u00a0 The \u201cout-of-pocket loss\u201d shall be no more than the difference between what the person paid for the product or service and what the product or service was actually worth in the absence of the unlawful act or practice.\\n(b) At least ten days prior to the commencement of any action brought under this section, any person intending to bring such an action shall notify the prospective defendant of the intended action, and give the prospective defendant an opportunity to confer with the person, the person\u2019s counsel, or other representative as to the proposed action.\u00a0 Such notice shall be given to the prospective defendant by mail, postage prepaid, to the prospective defendant\u2019s usual place of business, or if the prospective defendant has no usual place of business, to the prospective defendant\u2019s last known address.\\nIN STATES PROVIDING FOR AND OPTING TO MAINTAIN TREBLE DAMAGES, INCLUDE PARAGRAPHS (c) AND (d):\\n\\n(c)\u00a0 If the [court OR trier of fact] finds by clear and convincing evidence that the use or employment of the act or practice declared unlawful by [SECTION] was willful with the purpose of deceiving the public, the court may award up to three (3) times the actual damages sustained[, or $500 per person, whichever is greater].\u00a0 \u201cActual damages\u201d means the out-of-pocket loss the person sustained as a result of the unlawful act or practice and does not include judgment interest, attorneys\u2019 fees, or civil penalties.\\n(d)\u00a0 In determining whether to award enhanced damages under Subsection (b) and the amount of such penalty, the [court OR trier of fact] shall consider:\\n(1)\u00a0 if the amount of the actual damages awarded would have a deterrent effect upon the defendant;\\n(2)\u00a0 the seriousness of the violation, including the nature, circumstan...\n",

Adds to the list of telephone calls that are exempt from the \"do not call\" statute any telephone call made to a consumer by a caller that: (1) is: (A) a communications service provider that offers broadband internet service; or (B) a financial institution or a person licensed by the department of financial institutions to engage in first lien mortgage transactions or consumer credit transactions; and (2) has an established business relationship with the consumer. Requires the consumer protection division of the attorney general's office (division) to notify Indiana residents of the following: (1) The prohibition under federal law against a person making any call using an: (A) automatic telephone dialing system; or (B) artificial or prerecorded voice; to any telephone number assigned to a mobile telecommunications service. (2) The prohibition under federal law against a person initiating any telephone call to any residential telephone line using an artificial or prerecorded voice to deliver a message without the prior consent of the called party. (3) Information concerning the placement of a telephone number on the National Do Not Call Registry operated by the Federal Trade Commission. Allows the division to use the consumer protection division telephone solicitation fund (fund) to: (1) administer the statutes concerning: (A) the registration of telephone solicitors; and (B) the regulation of automatic dialing machines; and (2) reimburse county prosecutors for expenses incurred in extraditing violators of these and other state and federal statutes concerning telephone solicitations. (Current law provides that the fund may be used only to administer: (1) the state's \"do not call\" statute; (2) the federal statute concerning restrictions on the use of telephone equipment; and (3) the state statute concerning misleading or inaccurate caller identification (caller ID statute).) Provides that certain civil penalties recovered by the attorney general for violations of the statutes concerning: (1) the registration of telephone solicitors; and (2) the regulation of automatic dialing machines; shall be deposited in the fund. Defines \"executive\" for purposes of the \"do not call\" statute, and provides that an executive of a person that violates the \"do not call\" statute commits a separate deceptive act actionable by the division. Provides that the attorney general can collect attorney fees and costs in a civil action for a violation of the caller ID statute. Amends the definition of \"seller\" for purposes of the statute requiring telephone solicitors to register with the division, so that the definition includes any person making a telephone solicitation.

Adds to the list of telephone calls that are exempt from the \"do not call\" statute any telephone call made to a consumer by a caller that: (1) is: (A) a communications service provider that offers broadband internet service; or (B) a financial institution or a person licensed by the department of financial institutions to engage in first lien mortgage transactions or consumer credit transactions; and (2) has an established business relationship with the consumer. Requires the consumer protection division of the attorney general's office (division) to notify Indiana residents of the following: (1) The prohibition under federal law against a person making any call using an: (A) automatic telephone dialing system; or (B) artificial or prerecorded voice; to any telephone number assigned to a mobile telecommunications service. (2) The prohibition under federal law against a person initiating any telephone call to any residential telephone line using an artificial or prerecorded voice to deliver a message without the prior consent of the called party. (3) Information concerning the placement of a telephone number on the National Do Not Call Registry operated by the Federal Trade Commission. Allows the division to use the consumer protection division telephone solicitation fund (fund) to: (1) administer the statutes concerning: (A) the registration of telephone solicitors; and (B) the regulation of automatic dialing machines; and (2) reimburse county prosecutors for expenses incurred in extraditing violators of these and other state and federal statutes concerning telephone solicitations.

Provides that certain civil penalties recovered by the attorney general for violations of the statutes concerning: (1) the registration of telephone solicitors; and (2) the regulation of automatic dialing machines; shall be deposited in the fund.

Provides that the attorney general can collect attorney fees and costs in a civil action for a violation of the caller ID statute. Amends the definition of \"seller\" for purposes of the statute requiring telephone solicitors to register with the division, so that the definition includes any person making a telephone solicitation.
