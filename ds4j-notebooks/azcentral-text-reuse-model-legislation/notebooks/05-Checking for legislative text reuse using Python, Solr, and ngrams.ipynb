During times of storm, flood, fire, earthquake, hurricane or other disaster or emergency, many businesses bring in resources and personnel from other states throughout the U.S. on a temporary basis to expedite the often enormous and overwhelming task of cleaning up, restoring and repairing damaged buildings, equipment and property or even deploying or building new replacement facilities in the state.\\nB. This may involve the need for out-of-state businesses, including out-of-state affiliates of businesses based in the state to bring in resources, property and/or personnel that previously have had no connection to the state, to perform activity in the state including but not limited to repairing, renovating, installing, building, rendering services or other business activities and for which personnel may be located in the state for extended periods of time to perform such activities.\\nC. During such time of operating in the state on a temporary basis solely for purposes of helping the state recover from the disaster or emergency, these businesses and individual employees should not be burdened by any requirements for business and employee taxes as a result of such activities in the state for a temporary period.\\nD. The state\u2019s nexus and residency thresholds are intended for businesses and individuals in the state as part of the conduct of regular business operations or who intend to reside in the state and should not be directed at businesses and individuals coming into the state on a temporary basis to provide help and assistance in response to a Declared State Disaster or Emergency.\\nE. To ensure that businesses may focus on quick response to the needs of the state and its citizens during a Declared State Disaster or Emergency it is appropriate for the legislature to deem that such activity for a reasonable period of time before, during and after the disaster or emergency for repairing and restoration of the often devastating damage to property and infrastructure in the state shall not establish presence, residency, nor doing business in the state nor any other criteria for purposes of state and local taxes, lice...\n",
